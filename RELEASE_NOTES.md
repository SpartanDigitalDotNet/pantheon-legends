# Release Notes - Pantheon Legends v0.2.0

## 🚀 **Major Release: Type-Aware Framework**

**Release Date**: September 7, 2025  
**Version**: 0.2.0  
**Breaking Changes**: None (Fully backward compatible)

---

## 🎯 **What's New**

### **Enhanced Type System**
- **NEW**: `LegendType` enum for classifying engines (`TRADITIONAL`, `SCANNER`, `HYBRID`)
- **NEW**: `ReliabilityLevel` enum for quality classification (`HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `VARIABLE`, `EXPERIMENTAL`)
- **NEW**: Enhanced `QualityMeta` with scanner-specific risk metrics:
  - `false_positive_risk`: Quantifies signal reliability (0.0-1.0)
  - `manipulation_sensitivity`: Measures vulnerability to market manipulation (0.0-1.0)
  - `validation_period_years`: Historical validation timeframe

### **Base Classes for Engine Development**
- **NEW**: `TraditionalLegendBase` - Optimized for time-tested methodologies
  - Default: `HIGH` reliability, low false positive risk
  - Ideal for: Dow Theory, Elliott Wave, Wyckoff Method implementations
- **NEW**: `ScannerEngineBase` - Designed for algorithmic detection
  - Default: `VARIABLE` reliability, higher false positive risk awareness
  - Ideal for: Volume scanners, momentum detectors, pattern recognition

### **Type-Aware Orchestration**
- **NEW**: `Pantheon.get_engines_by_type()` - Filter engines by classification
- **NEW**: `Pantheon.get_engines_by_reliability()` - Filter by minimum reliability
- **NEW**: `Pantheon.get_consensus_analysis()` - Weighted consensus with type filtering
- **ENHANCED**: `available_engines` now returns type and reliability metadata

  - Validation: 125 years of market history
- **UPDATED**: `WyckoffLegendEngine` now inherits from `TraditionalLegendBase`
  - Type: `TRADITIONAL` 
  - Reliability: `HIGH`
  - Validation: 100 years of market history

### **Scanner Engine Examples**
- **NEW**: `VolumeBreakoutScanner` - Example algorithmic detection engine
  - Type: `SCANNER`
  - Reliability: `VARIABLE`
  - Includes false positive risk and manipulation sensitivity metrics

---

## 📊 **Usage Examples**

### **Conservative Analysis (Traditional Only)**
```python
import legends
from legends import LegendType

pantheon = legends.Pantheon.create_default()

# Get only traditional legend engines for conservative analysis
traditional_engines = pantheon.get_engines_by_type(LegendType.TRADITIONAL)

# Run consensus excluding scanner engines
consensus = pantheon.get_consensus_analysis(
    symbol="AAPL",
    data=market_data,
    include_scanner_engines=False
)
```

### **Reliability-Filtered Analysis**
```python
from legends import ReliabilityLevel

# Get only high-reliability engines
high_reliability = pantheon.get_engines_by_reliability(ReliabilityLevel.HIGH)

# Set minimum reliability threshold for consensus
consensus = pantheon.get_consensus_analysis(
    symbol="TSLA",
    data=market_data,
    min_reliability=ReliabilityLevel.MEDIUM
)
```

### **Building Custom Engines**
```python
from legends import TraditionalLegendBase, ScannerEngineBase

# Traditional Legend Development
class ElliottWaveLegend(TraditionalLegendBase):
    @property
    def name(self) -> str:
        return "Elliott Wave Theory"
    
    # Automatically inherits HIGH reliability defaults

# Scanner Engine Development  
class MomentumScanner(ScannerEngineBase):
    @property
    def name(self) -> str:
        return "Momentum Breakout Scanner"
    
    # Automatically inherits VARIABLE reliability with risk metrics
```

---

## 🛡️ **Risk Management Features**

### **False Positive Awareness**
- Scanner engines now include `false_positive_risk` metrics
- Traditional legends maintain lower false positive profiles
- Consensus analysis weights results by reliability

### **Manipulation Sensitivity**
- New `manipulation_sensitivity` metric for algorithmic engines
- Helps users understand vulnerability to market manipulation
- Particularly important for volume-based and momentum scanners

### **Validation Transparency**
- `validation_period_years` shows historical validation depth
- Traditional legends: 100+ years of market validation
- Scanner engines: Shorter validation periods reflecting algorithmic nature

---

## 🎉 **Benefits**

### **For Traders & Analysts**
- **Clear Risk Profile**: Understand the reliability of each engine
- **Flexible Analysis**: Choose conservative (traditional) or comprehensive (all engines)
- **Informed Decisions**: Reliability-weighted consensus analysis
- **False Signal Awareness**: Know which engines are prone to false positives

### **For Developers**
- **Structured Development**: Clear base classes with appropriate defaults
- **Type Safety**: Enum-based classification system
- **Quality Guidance**: Built-in quality metrics and risk awareness
- **Easy Integration**: Type-aware orchestration handles complexity

---

## 🔄 **Migration Guide**

### **Existing Code (No Changes Required)**
All existing code continues to work without modification:
```python
# This still works exactly the same
pantheon = legends.Pantheon.create_default()
engines = pantheon.available_engines  # Now returns enhanced metadata
```

### **Enhanced Usage (Optional)**
Take advantage of new features:
```python
# New type-aware capabilities
traditional_only = pantheon.get_engines_by_type(LegendType.TRADITIONAL)
high_reliability = pantheon.get_engines_by_reliability(ReliabilityLevel.HIGH)
consensus = pantheon.get_consensus_analysis(symbol, data)
```

### **New Engine Development**
Use new base classes for better defaults:
```python
# Before
class MyEngine(ILegendEngine):
    # Had to implement everything from scratch

# After  
class MyEngine(TraditionalLegendBase):  # or ScannerEngineBase
    # Inherits appropriate defaults for reliability and risk metrics
```
